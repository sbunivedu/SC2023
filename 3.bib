	abstract = {In this tutorial, participants will be introduced to Bloom's for Computing: Enhancing Bloom's Revised Taxonomy with Verbs for Computing Disciplines, a project of the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges). Due for final publication by the end of 2022, the Bloom's for Computing report offers a total 57 enhanced verbs across all six levels of Bloom's cognitive domain - Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating. The enhanced verb list is intended to support crafting more appropriate and less awkward learning outcomes and competencies that express the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required in computing disciplines. The Bloom's for Computing verb list and report is not just for use in future ACM curriculum guideline reports, but is primarily for educators in computing disciplines who find themselves needing to craft learning outcomes or competencies - whether for programs, courses, or individual modules; whether two-year, four-year, graduate, or K-12 level; whether faculty, instructional designers, or program coordinators.},

	abstract = {Learning outcomes serve as reference points for assessing course success, for building prerequisite structures, for determining credit transferability to other institutions, and for ensuring program completion. Technical disciplines have found it more difficult to design learning outcomes because discipline-specific terminology has not been compatible with the existing verbs listed in Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. Computing faculty representing different disciplines, including Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science, will serve as panelists to explain their approach to creating effective learning outcomes using the Bloom's for Computing list of computing-related verbs to enhance Bloom's Revised Taxonomy.},

	abstract = {This lightning talk describes an in-progress project led by the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) to enhance the Bloom's Revised Taxonomy verb list with verbs that focus on computing competencies. Many colleges and universities, as well as organization-led curriculum projects (such as those of the ACM CCECC), use Bloom's Revised Taxonomy with its six levels of cognition to represent the level of cognitive depth a student is expected to achieve for a given competency or learning outcome. There are verb lists that associate verbs with each of the cognitive levels. For example, the verb "define" is associated with the lowest level, Remembering; the verb "develop" is associated with the highest level, Creating. Standard verb lists do not include verbs specific to computing disciplines, which can make it challenging to craft computing-centric learning outcomes. This project is an effort to enhance the standard verb lists with verbs that focus on computing competencies, such as "configure" at the Applying level and "trace" at the Analyzing level. An initial list of about 90 possible new verbs was presented to various computing communities for feedback, including via a poster at SIGCSE 2020. The list has been refined by the project team, and we are seeking another round of community input.},

The recent emerging computing areas ought to enhance the existing list of verbs in Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. This poster presents 85 possible verbs to enhance the framework, 34 of which are technical verbs related to computing areas. Educators from two- and four-year institutions can benefit from the enhanced verbs proposed in this work to include in their computing programs.},
