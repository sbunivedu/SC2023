abstract = {Software bugs are a common problem that students encounter in any Computer Science program. "Bug Wars" is a fun and competitive class exercise for student teams to identify bugs in code. To prepare for the competition, the instructor provides several code examples that contain bugs. Each student team also develops code that has a bug. All of the code examples are placed on a table in the classroom at the beginning of class. The competition then begins by each team taking one problem to solve and checking with the author of the respective code to ask whether they correctly identified the bug. If they solve the bug, we update the score and they swap the problem that they solved for a new problem. The team that identifies the most bugs wins the competition. The majority of students reported that this activity increased their interest in software testing and made them more aware of bugs that they should avoid on future assignments.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the integration of unit tests into a first semester programming course. The students were supplied with unit tests to support their learning and assessments. A questionnaire was completed by the student cohort about their use and perceptions of these unit tests. As a result of both the students and our experiences we examine the advantages and disadvantages of introducing unit tests early and make some pedagogical recommendations for the introduction and use of unit tests in first year programming.},
